# unipdb

This repo contains cross information between PDB codes and Uniprot Accession IDs. Usually, you need a PDB+chain combination to get the exact Uniprot ID and vice versa. Thus the main functions of this python tool are:

1. Get a list of (chain, Uniprot ID) given a PDB ID;

2. Get a list of (PDB, chain) given a Uniprot ID.

## Roadmap

- [ ] A python library and command line tool to achieve the above two functions.
- [ ] A simple web app to query the information.
- [ ] More similar functions
